SteamStub DRM unpacker.

Scans game directories for SteamStub-protected executables and
unpacks them using Steamless (existing in third_party/).

Tries Steamless against every .exe in the game directory; the tool
internally selects the matching unpacker variant for the wrapper
version (V10x86, V20x86, V21x86, V30x86, V30x64, V31x86, V31x64).
