# Best-effort post-save enrichment for HubCap and Ryuu .lua files. Some
# DLCs ship as their own appid with no depots and just piggyback on the
# parent game's manifest, so they need an addappid(<dlc_appid>) line in
# the .lua to actually unlock. OurEveryday already does this inline; the
# helper here lets HubCap and Ryuu match that coverage without copying
# the appinfo walk into their own modules.
