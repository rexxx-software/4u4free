"""Manifest preserver.

Steam wipes `<steam>/depotcache/<depot>_<gid>.manifest` when the user
uninstalls a game from the Steam UI. SteaMidra has its own canonical
copy of every manifest it ever downloaded, sitting in the writable
staging directory next to SteaMidra.exe (`<sff_data>/manifests/`),
because every download path writes to that folder before staging into
depotcache.

Strategy: do NOT make a separate backup. The staging dir IS the backup.
A lightweight watcher checks the two Steam-side caches and, when a
manifest disappears, copies it back from the staging dir if a copy
exists there. Cheap, no extra disk usage, no startup walk.

Public surface:
    start_watcher(steam_path) -> None
    restore_manifest(deleted_path) -> bool

Failures (missing pywin32, missing inotify_simple, missing depotcache,
broken disk) log and continue without raising.
