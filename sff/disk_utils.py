"""Safe disk enumeration.

Wraps drive-letter scanning in per-drive OSError guards and skips volumes
that Windows exposes but cannot actually read: BitLocker-locked drives,
Linux ext4/btrfs/xfs partitions, RAW/corrupt filesystems, recovery/EFI
partitions, offline disks, empty optical drives and SD readers, network
drives that have disconnected, and permission-blocked paths.

Every caller that used to iterate A-Z directly should call
iter_accessible_drives or find_steam_libraries_on_disk instead,
which handle all the edge cases and log every skip with a reason.
